# TPL-Dataflow-Testing


This tutorial contains some examples that I built during the process of learning TPL. This is not a groomed repo so some of these examples might have errors or not work at all. 

Use at your own risk. 

If this repo interested you checkout my Microsoft Orleans Prototype [repo](https://github.com/dills122/Orleans-Prototype)


Here is a link to the [TPL Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library) and an introductory tutorial I wrote on [TPL](https://dills122.github.io/Blog/).
